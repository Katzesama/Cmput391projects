    Since the b tree is index the value based on range, so when the program do the searching query in q4, it will search the MBR based on range of each attributes of areaMBR. However, r tree is indexing the table based on space. It does not need to search over all the attributes, it just search over the space(rectangle) to find objects(MBR). And from the above results we can see the database file with R-tree indexing is faster than B-tree indexing. Therefore, group the MBRs in space is better than group them based on each attributes of MBR.
